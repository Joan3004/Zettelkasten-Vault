**Programming Method**:

1. Define the problem that you would like to solve
2. *Determine how you are going to solve the problem*
	Good Solutions have:
	- They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).
	- They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
	- They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
	- They are robust, and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.
